			<h3>An ode to favorite sites of mine</h3>
			<h4>Not really. But here are my breakdowns of my top three favorite site designs.</h4>
			Uber.com is one of my favorite sites, simply because I love the asthetic that Uber employs in designing their website and their app.<br/>
			When you look at the homepage, your eye is drawn to the center to a button to take you to the sign-up page. Stepping back makes no difference...the minimalist design bring your attention to the center, where the sign-up button is located.
			I would describe the website as sleek, modern, elegant, fashionable, and minimalistic. The website solves the problem of selling people affordable, yet sexy, transportation on demand. It contains pages explaining the service, how to sign up for the service, and pages to actually use the service.<br/>
			I would describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site as stylish, serious, luxurious, practical, and sexy. The adjectives describing the website's content reflect the service they render.<br/>
			It's incredibly easy to find everything you're looking for from the homepage. In addition to the minimalist design, they also have a comprehensive pop-up menu that can take you anywhere you want to go. Since the pop-up menu follows you from page to page, it's easy to navigate to where you're interested in going from any page. Finally, the genius (to me, at least) of this site is that the user is presented with finite options, meaning that it's hard to get lost or bogged down in details. The pop-up menu facilitates browsing through all the content of the site with ease. Due to the lack of information on the website, though, it's hard to remain engaged by it for extended periods of time.<br/>
			The site sells cab rides in luxury cars. I have purchased rides from Uber, though I haven't used their site (I used the iOS app). However, the site and the app both remain major draws--they embody the core values of the service being rendered--an elegant and classy ride that still remains relatively affordable.

			Dappered.com is another favorite site--I've been interested for a while now in starting to dress myself better and I like the clear and concise layout that they employ in addition to the great style advice.<br/>
			When you look at their homepage, your eye is drawn to a large scrolling graphic/caption that advertises their top/most recent stories to the center left. When you step back, your eye is drawn still to the graphic, but also to the static banner at the top containing the website's name is a stylish font, and in smalller letters, the website's motto.<br/>
			I would describe the website's visual aesthetic as clean, stylish, simple, basic, and white. The website is geared towards giving style advice to both those men who are just getting into style as well as those keeping up with the latest trends and sales. The content, focus, and purpose of the site can be aptly described as stylish, fun, serious, and practical.<br/>
			It's fairly easy to find what you're looking for from the main page as well as from other pages because all pages have a menu bar that goes across the top of every page. The menu bar does a good job of breaking down the different categories a user might be interested in reaching. Browsing through all the content of the site is more difficult--the search bar at the top of the site, while nice, only presents results by chronological results and the tags associated with each post are often not enough to go on. For example, I was looking for blog posts that dealt with building a wardrobe from scratch, which for a site like this I would anticipate would be something many users might be interested in. However, it required searching through many unrelated posts to find something straightforward, and even then it didn't seem thorough.<br/>
			I can spend a significant period of time on the site without getting bored, though. Its content is engaging and the blog posts are a great length that they're digestable without needing to spend too much time on any single blog post. The site does not sell anything.<br/>
		</p>

			Google.com is my final favorite site--it's been my go-to search engine since high school and still feels as though it gives the best results of any search engine. <br/> 
			When looking at the homepage, my eye is most drawn to the google doodle and the search bar. The open space means that your eyes still fall to the center of the main page, regardless of distance to the monitor. <br/>
			Visually, I'd say the website is clean, uncluttered, white, open, and approachable. The website solves the problem of finding exactly what you're looking for on the web. It has search results and advertisements. I'd say that the content, focus, and purpose of this website could be aptly described as practical, focused, whimsical, minimalist, and serious.It's incredibly easy to navigate as there are only a few options in the menu bar that one uses regularly, and most of these follow the user throughout the experience on the site. Navigating through all the content on the site is nigh impossible, given the number of search results that are generally returned. <br/>
			Additionally, as google has added services over the years, sometimes navigating to certain services like scholar.google.com are more difficult from the main menu. I start to get bored from spending too much time on the website because the minimalist design doesn't particularly engage me. The site itself doesn't sell anything, though it does facilitate advertisements and sales of items through other sites.
