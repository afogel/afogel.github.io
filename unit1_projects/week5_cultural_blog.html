Let's talk about women in tech.

So, if you're not already hip to the fact that there is a serious gender inequality in the world of tech workers, I'll clue you in: it's a problem. Sadly, it doesn't seem to be a new problem, either. Women, for whatever the reason, have not been able to change disproportionately small representation of females in the industry for years and years, despite initiatives to help improve gender parity.

So, what is going on here? Well, it's a multi-faceted issue. We could point to one issue being the smaller proportion of women to men that study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Others, however, have pointed to a similar situation that was raised about investment banking in the 1990s/early 2000s--it's a boys club. And when it's a boy's club, it's kind of difficult to integrate without feeling like an imposter (or so I read from first hand accounts^,^^). Women who have been interviewed for articles have reported feeling as though it's difficult to be taken seriously as a woman who codes and so they have to do everything possible to blend into the frequently well-intentioned but gender-instensitive work culture. Additionally, various articles cite a lack of willingness on the part of hiring managers to hire more women...frequently, there is a sense that women get hired or asked to talk in order to fill a gender quota and not simply because they're the best person for the task.

What steps have been taken to improve this issue? Well, there are schools like HackBright Academy or all-female hackathons that focus on developing women in particular. I think that these institutions serve a necessary and important purpose, but they are divisive. Some think that they actually solidy the perception that women are "weak" and need an extra leg up. I think that, like the way affirmative action has helped increase diversity in higher education, these institutions act as an accessible and safe gateway for women to enter into the tech field. However, I think that's just half the battle--once initiated into the workplace by having the skill set, the culture of the workplace needs to changed from the inside out.

I think that it's of utmost importance that the new initiates of the workforce, and especially men, try and become advocates for gender parity. One suggestion to increase the number of women in tech was made by Caroline Drucker in an engaging <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUvRPmL61SI">talk</a>: simply start calling women in the tech industry by what they are--women, not girls. Small shifts in the norms and mores of the culture can ultimately chip away at the overall perception and influence a lasting change.

I think that local, grassroots change begets systemic change, so increasing awareness and sensitivity before someone enters the industry is crucial. I think this best occurs during the education process/before someone actually has entered into industry. With programs like DBC spending a good deal of effort emphasizing awareness of important issues like gender equality in the tech world, a new generation of programmers can begin to shape workplace cultures around the country and contribute to a workplace revolution. A gesture like adjusting your terminology, as was suggested by Caroline Drucker, can make an impact. It won't happen overnight, but it will change what ideas and behaviors are considered acceptable and "normal" in tech companies.
