				<h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>
			</header>
				<h1>Monday, May 19 2014</h1>
				<p>
					So, let's talk about emotional conflicts...well, the most recent emotional conflict that I can remember is one that happened between me and my father. Sometimes, I do this thing where I am pissed (sometimes, rightfully so) at something but displace my anger. In this particular scenario, I had been fighting with an airline company because they broke fragile cargo and the hard, flight-ready container that it was transported it and were refusing to accept any onus for the damages. In fact, they were being downright difficult even to try to explain the nature of the problem and let me show them the extent of the damages. So after about a week of fightin with them, I turned to my father for advice. I was pretty furious with the way I had been treated and, while he knew that I was raising my voice and yelling about the airline company, he personally felt uncomfortable by how agitated I was getting. He expressed to me that he recognized I wasn't raising my voice <i>at him</i>, but the fact that my voice was raised and I was agitated about the situation was making him feel less willing to try to help me.

					So. What to do. I recognized that the anger I was feeling was being misdirected towards him, even if I wasn't yelling <i>at</i> him or about some dynamic of our own relationship. In this particular situation, I was able to take a few deep breaths and try to stop myself from riling myself up further. Slowly, I calmed down and was able to restart the dynamic of the conversation to a place where my father became more recepetive to me and was more willing to help. If I could go back, I would try to start the process of calming myself down earlier...it's easy to get caught up in the anger and keep riling yourself up. The sooner you can catch it (and especially if it happens before someone feels the need to call you out on it), but better, I think.
				</p>

					I think one of the most important tools I've learned to use is reality-testing....that is, checking to see how others percieved your behavior, especially if there are multiple witnesses to said behavior. Ultimately, what I learned from this experience is that I need to continue to be mindful of how I come across and remain vigilant in my attempts to curb less desirable behavior as soon as I notice it and not get carried away by it.
