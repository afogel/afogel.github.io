	<h1>Coping with Emotional Turmoil in the context of an intensive program</h1>
	<h3>June 8, 2014</h3>
	<p>
		This blog post is challenging for me to write about because it surrounds stereotype threat, a phenomenon that I have seldom, if ever, experienced as a member of groups with predominantly positive stereotypes associated with them. <br>
		During the first week of phase 0 in DBC, we were asked to identify values we associated with feeling the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied that we've been during our lives. I identified the following values: feeling a sense of <em>accomplishment</em>, <em>confident</em>, <em>enthusiastic</em>, <em>passionate</em>, <em>when I had many close relationships</em>, and when I was <em>helping other people</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this blog post, we were asked how we feel when thinking about those values and whether they can help mediate stereotype threat if we recognize it. Given the fact that Stereotype Threat does not really apply to me, I'm going to simply try to focus on describing a few mechanisms I've worked on developing in order to cope with emotional turmoil and what will come in handy during such an intense program.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, I think it's important that if I'm "feeling down" while at DBC, I take a breath. And then afterwards, I take another. I'm planning to make a conscientious effort to meditate, focusing on my body and the way it's experiencing the turmoil. I think that finding an outlet to talk through whatever issues I'm struggling with will also be of paramount importance, but I also have to recognize that chances are I won't be able to address it/talk it out immediately, so there's some element of just needing to live with the discomfort. This is an exercise that is incredibly challenging for me, but I have been working through more and more. Finally, it will be important to recognize if/when I become overwhelmed so I can take a break and resume later. Here's to being prepared! As always, this work is a never-ending process and I strive to continue working on it.
