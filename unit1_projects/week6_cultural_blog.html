	<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
	<h3>June 5, 2014</h3>
	<p>
		What is Stereotype Threat? The concept of Stereotype Threat is one that was developed by Claude Steele over the course of his career. Stereotype threat is defined as "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" (<a href="#ref1">1</a>). But what does that really mean?
	</p>
	<p>
		Stereotype threat was first explored in the context of academic achievement of minorities in primary and secondary schools. In American culture, there exists a negative stereotype that non-white or Hispanic students perform more poorly than their white, non-Hispanic peers. Research on this phenomenon has found that, when reminded of their racial/ethnic background, non-White or Hispanic students <i>did</i> perform more poorly on standardized tests than their White, non-Hispanic counterparts. However, when race/ethnicity was not emphasized, the achievement gap was diminished, if not eliminated. It's hypothesized that the cause of this discrepancy in performance is that, when reminded of elements of our identity negative stereotypes associated with them, we identify with the social narrative constructed and maintained for us by our culture and unconsciously self-handicap ourselves to conform to the narrative.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I'm being totally candid, I don't think I've personally experienced stereotype threat in any tangible way. This is mainly because as a White, heterosexual Jewish American male, I identify with groups that tend to have a great deal of privilege and are frequently associated with positive stereotypes. However, I think it's important to be aware of the impact of stereotype threat when entering as homogenous an industry the tech industry--perhaps stereotype threat contributes to and helps perpetuate the homogenous makeup of the industry's workforce.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that in mind, I think it's important to identify actionable steps that I can take if I notice a situation in which stereotype threat might be negatively impacting myself or those around me, especially as I enter Dev Bootcamp's training. Social psychology research on the phenomenon posits that there are a handful of strategies that have been observed to diminish the impact of stereotype threat. Some strategies that I think may be particularly relevant to me personally include reframing the task to deemphasize its dependence on identity based attributes, encouraging self-affirmation, providing/looking to role models that have already succeeded, and providing external attributions for difficulty. I know I just named a lot of strategies without explaining them or providing examples as to how they might be employed, so let's change that!
	</p>
	<p>
		hen identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?
		A lot of the strategies I just named focus on intellectually separating one's group identity(s) from their personal ability to succeed at whatever task they attempt to accomplish. In the context of Dev Bootcamp, this might be most relevant to the way we give and receive feedback. Dev Bootcamp's culture strongly emphasizes giving and receiving specific, actionable and kind feedback to both students and the program itself. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One way I think I can personally diminish the impact of stereotype threat is by adhering to DBC's prinicples on giving feedback. I believe that giving feedback that is specific and actionable refocuses the recipient's attention onto behaviors that can be modified and exemplifies that the feedback is based on/due to how the recipeient's performance on a given task. The kindness is just kind of a gimme :)
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, the very act of receiving and giving regular feedback to an individual that might be impacted by stereotype threat seems like a good means of counteracting the phenomenon's impact. To me, it seems reasonable that by virtue of seeing progress and improved performance through regular feedback will bolster one's sense of potential success and make in-group characteristics seem like a less important factor to achieve high performance. Hopefully this works, but I'll try to follow up on my assumptions and hypotheses once I actually get into the thick of things! Til then, adieu :)
