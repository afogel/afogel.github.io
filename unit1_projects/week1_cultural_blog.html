			<h1>Cultural Blog Post 1</h1>
			<h3>Sunday, April 27 2014</h3>
			<p>
				Throughout my life, I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied when I felt a sense of <em>accomplishment</em>, when I felt <em>confident</em>, <em>enthusiastic</em>, <em>passionate</em>, <em>when I had many close relationships</em>, and when I was <em>helping other people</em>.
				<br><br>
				I believe that when I help other people it helps imbue purpose to my actions. By helping others achieve their goals, I get a sense of satisfaction both by knowing that they're in a better place than they were before, as well as the fact that I was the person that helped them reach their goal. I also believe that by helping others/engaging in prosocial behavior, we create additional positivity in our own lives and set ourselves up to strengthen the existing relationships we cherish.
				<br><br>
				In general, I would say that I live up to the values I think contribute to my greatest satisfaction very well (a 4-5 on a 5 point scale, where 5 is the highest and 1 is the lowest) with a single exception. I think that while close relationships are indeed important to my satisfaction with life, I struggle with maintaining/developing them often and would rate how much I live up to that "value" as perhaps a 1-2 on the same scale; superficially, I believe that I have eclectic tastes that make it so that I often feel the need to segment my personality. Thus, I feel as though relationships that I make based on only a single portion of the personality that I'm showing feel superficial and I convince myself that perhaps those relationships don't merit developing or would be impossible to develop. I have frequently found that it's only in relationships with significant others that I have been able to show all aspects of my personality comfortably.
				<br><br>
				The last topic that someone asked my advice about was about relationships. Ironically, I think that I'm not half-bad at doling out advice and interpretting a given situation appropriately, but when it comes to figuring out how to find balance in my own relationships, I genuinely struggle.
