				<h1>Javascript's popularity!</h1>
			</header>
				<h1>Sunday, May 11 2014</h1>

					Hello, dear reader! It's time for our next installment, trying to understand why the heck people love to use this strange language for web development, JavaScript (JS). Well, if we're totally candid, a lot of people maintain a steady love/hate relationship with JS, but why sweat the details? I mean, it's a way more friendly language than Java or C++ (if you want to be proven correct, try looking up those languages' "Hello World" programs some time versus JavaScript's cute `console.log("Hello World")'), but still what gives? The fact of the matter is that JS is pretty much <em>the</em> language for web development, but to understand why, we have to go back to the beginning. Of Creation. Of Everything. Web-browser related that is, dummy ;)
				</p>
				<p>
					Alright, so Javascript has pretty much been here since we started using web browsers (read: 1995), and for those of us who vaguely remember the bloody battles over which web browsers were the best in the 90s, let me remind you. There were bloody battles over which web browser was the best. Anyway, Javascript tried to appease everyone. It was at first used for fun little things like leaving a trail of where your mouse had been within the browser. Pretty, but not particularly useful. But that was all going to change when something called AJAX came onto the scene.
				</p>
				<p>
					AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Without going into to much detail, it basically lets your web page be dynamic without having to load a <em>completely</em> new website. If you're having trouble understanding what that means, just think about the handy autocomplete function that we now all take for granted on the main page of Google. Basically, google doesn't load a completely new web page when it tries to suggest what you're actually trying to type into the search box. It uses AJAX (and importantly, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>) to accomplish the dynamic nature of the web page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, I think it merits mentioning that people have been constantly revamping JS to make it better and easier to use. Usually, we devs call this "creating additional libraries for the language" or some variation on that theme. I just want to mention one cross-platform library called JQuery that was introduced in 2006 and basically addressed a lot of the issues that a lot of people had with JS when used for stuff like AJAX. So a lot more people stopped kvetching and starting hacking. And it was good.
				<p>
					So, overall, you might be thinking that JavaScript can do some cool stuff, but like, whatever, you've seen more impressive things in life. It's not like it's the whole package or anything, right? I mean, if you wanted to write something more complicated that just a silly web page that has so flashy things that it can do dynamically, you need to learn a COMPLETELY new language like Ruby, Python, or PHP, right?! Actually, funny you should mention it. JavaScript can do that, too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to a [relatively] new development in *ahem* development, there's this nifty thing called `node.js'. This `node.js' business basically allows you to write the more complicated parts to a web app that make it functional beyond a pretty picture (known to developers as a back-end) as well as give it all the cool flair that you think all slick web-sites should embody nowaday with their new-fangled sliding transitions and all that other higgery-majiggery (known to developers as higgery-majiggery**). Basically, it makes it so that you can use Javascipt for EVERYTHING.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a lot of other benefits to Javascript, but in all, I guess I could sum up Javascript's popularity pretty simply: <br><ol>
					<li>1) It's been around since forever, so most people are used to using it/familiar with it.</li>
					<li>2) It's way more friendly than a lot of other languages that are sometimes used for the same purposes *ahem*ugly Java applets*ahem*</li>
					<li>3) It is capable of nifty front-end stuff, thanks to AJAX (and I didn't mention HTML5, but that too)</li>
					<li>and 4) Finally, it's capable of handling back-end stuffs, thanks to node.js.<li>
					</ol><br>
					So basically, JS is the web-dev language of choice. It's versatile, [relatively] easy to use, and can be really smart if you give it the chance. So don't hate unless you're a hater. Or something like that.
				</p>
				<p>**just kidding. It's called the front-end. Not as fun, but I guess it makes more sense, given the fact that the other side is the 'back-end', right?</p>
