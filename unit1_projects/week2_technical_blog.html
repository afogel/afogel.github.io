				<h1>Classes versus IDs</h1>
			</header>
				<h1>Sunday, May 4 2014</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, dear reader! You may recently have woken up in a cold sweat after a restless night's sleep. I know I have. I bet it was for the same reason: you were wondering...WHEN THE HECK DO I USE A CLASS VERSUS AN ID?! 
				</p>
				<p>
					CSS is tricky. I know. But we can get through this together. So, on the count of three, I'll let you in on the simple, dirty secret: One.. Two.. Three!
				</p>
				<p>
					A class is what you use when styling multiple elements throughout the page.<br>
					An ID is what you use when you're just trying to apply CSS to a single element on the page.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You may be asking, "What, Ariel, does that really mean?!". So instead of just reiterating a confusing message, let's look at an example!
					Let's say that I'm as awesome as amazon.com and want to litter my page with yellow buttons. Actually, because I'm more awesome than Amazon, I'm going to litter my page with little <em>green</em> buttons! This is a job for: <span class="button"> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere">a class</a>!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I'm planning on using multiple <span class="button"> buttons</span> in my page, I'll use a class because, hell, that's what the best-practice Gods of Coding told me to do. And we don't want make the Gods angry, now do we?
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, let's say that you had a pointless cat picture that you wanted to use to pay tribute to the best-practice Gods of Coding. We know that to appease the anger of said Gods, we only need to pay tribute once on any given page, right? ...We <i> do </i> know that, I hope? WELLLLLL let's just take my word for it. So if we just have the one picture on our entire page and we want to use CSS to resize it, THAT MIGHT BE AN EXCELLENT USE OF AN ID! Or, you know, you could apply it to a more practical purpose, like when you're writing a blog post in a single element. To each his or her own, I suppose. CHENNNYWAY, that's the basic difference. I hope you get it!
